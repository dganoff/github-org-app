GitHub Repository App
===================

## Setup

To get started:

    $ npm install
    $ bower install

This will get you the necessary node and bower packages to do everything
within this project. It's recommended that you install the grunt-cli globally
(`$ npm install -g grunt-cli`) so you can use `grunt` for the tasks.

## Development

Run `grunt serve` to build the app and start the local server at `http://localhost:9000`.

## Tests

Run `grunt test` to run all unit tests.
